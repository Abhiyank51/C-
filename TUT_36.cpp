// INHERITANCE IN C++
// Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs
// In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it
// Reusing classes saves time and money
// Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of
// developing and debugging the same thing again.

// What is Inheritance in C++

// The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using Inheritance
// We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inherititing from it
// The existing class is called as the Base Class
// The new class which is inherited is called as the Derived Class
// Reusing classes saves time and money
// There are different types of inheritance in C++ 

// FORMS OF INHERITANCE IN C++

// Single Inheritance
// Multiple Inheritance
// Hierarchical Inheritance
// Multilevel Inheritance
// Hybrid Inheritance

// A------->B  (means a derives b)
// A<-------B  (means b is derived from a)

// Single Inheritance
// A derived class with only one Base class
//    A------>B  (A is base class , B is derived class)


// Multiple Inheritance
// A derived class with more than one Base class
// (A and B is base class , C is derived class)
// A------>
//           C
// B------>


// Hierarchical Inheritance
// Several derived classes from a single base class.
// (C is base class , A and B is derived class)
//          A
//C ------>
//          B


// Multilevel Inheritance
// Deriving a class from already derived class
// (A is base class, B is derived class and C is multilevel derived class)
// A---->B----->C


// Hybrid Inheritance
// Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and
// multilevel inheritance.
// A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance.
// However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
//          B----------------->
// A------->                    D
//          C----------------->
