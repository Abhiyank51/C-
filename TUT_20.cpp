// OOPS IN C++

// C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented features
// to C language.

// As the size of the program increases, readability, maintainability and bug-free nature of
// programs decreases.

// This was the major problem with languages like C which relied upon functions or
// procedures (hence the name procedural programming language)

// As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem in an effective manner was high.

// Also, as data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised.

// Using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario.





// PROCEDURAL ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE(POP)

// Consists of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow

// Main focus is on functions and not on flow Of data

// Functions can either use local or global data

// Data moves openly from function to function




// OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING(OOP)

// Works on the concept of classes and objects

// A class is a template to create objects

// Treats data as a critical element

// Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around
// the objects




// BASIC CONCEPTS IN OOP

// Classes — Basic template for creating objects.

// Objects — Basic run time entities.

// Data Abstraction & Encapsulation —VVrapping data and functions into single unit.

// Abstraction = layering on encapsulated data.

// Inheritance — Properties of one class can be inherited into others.

// Polymorphism — ability to take more than one forms.

// Dynamic Binding — code which will execute is not known until the program.
// runs.

// Message Passing — Object.message(lnformation) call format.





// Benefits of OOP

// Better code reusability using Objects and Inheritance.

// Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.

// Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference.

// Software complexity can be easily managed.
