// Polymorphism in C++
// Poly = many, morphism = form , many-form of one thing
// one name multiple forms = polymorphism
// eg. function overloading, operator overloading, virtual functions

// Polymorphism are of two types:
// 1. Compile time polymorphism
// -> object is bound from function call in complie time.
// -> decision is already taken in the compile time that which function should we call
// also calles early binding, starting binding
// This polymorphism can be achieved by two types
//      -> Function Overloading
//      -> Operator Overloading
// here we already know which function should call, compiler earlier binded the objects in the function


// 2. Run time polymorphism
// It is achieve in C++ with the help of virtual functions.
// it will postpone or late the decision of which function should be call this is known as differ
// you will know later that which function is called , means after compile time.
// it will not take decision earlier,it will take decision later to ehich function should call, after run time.

// binding means which function should call which object
